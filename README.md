### Our mission
In these troubling times, people seek to reduce the number of human contacts to the bare minimum in order to care for their health. This is especially true for the elderly. However, this is not possible in every situation, such as shopping for groceries. People with technological knowledge have the means of ordering it home from the Internet, but according to Eurostat, 87% of people aged 75 or over have never been online. They do, however, know how to use a phone and make phone calls. This is where Shoplyft fills the gap. We provide an AI powered phone assistant for the people in need. The user can have a conversation with the voice assistant, list the items needed and the rest is taken care of by us and our partner stores. The groceries are delivered straight to the user's home. No internet needed, no human assistants needed.
